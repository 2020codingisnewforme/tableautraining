# Data Visualization with Tableau

These charts, graphs, and maps were the exercises and challenges associated with a course I completed at Udemy.com. You will need to download these files and open them in Tableau. However, I have also included a Powerpoint deck of the visualizations for those without Tableau installed on their machine. Do note that the visualizations, dashboards, and stories are dynamic within Tableau with features such as highlighting and filtering. This interativity is lost in the PowerPoint version.

## Exercise 1

A very basic bar chart analyzing the sales figures of a company broken down by salesperson.

## Exercise 2

A time series chart illustrating unemployment rates by age from 2005-2015.

## Exercise 3

A map showing a company's profit margins in Western and Central Europe. This exercise included data feature creation.

## Exercise 4

A basic dual axis chart.

## Exercise 5

A second dual axis chart showing sales data compared to target sales. The data is broken out by category.

## Exercise 6

A chart using data blended from multiple sources.

## Exercise 7

This exercise includes multiple chards, dashboard, and story. All data is interactive. It illustrates sales data for a company within the UK. The data is filtered by region as well as other factors.

## Exercise 8

This exercise illustrates basic data analysis in Tableau. Clustering techniques and Regression are used to analyze the profitablity of a start-up company looking to expand its operations.

## Data

I have included the data files for all the exercises above.
